    <p class="biotext">I was born on July 25, 2006, in what can be considered very northern California (that is, my neighbors have more in common with Alabamians than Los Angeles folk). My childhood was quite good, with all of the first-world-country luxuries an American child could expect; however, it was plagued by obesity and what I would soon discover to be a physical disability. An entrance into homeschooling in junior high fixed the byproducts of these disadvantages—bullying, namely—but also caused myriad unforeseen side effects—a more timid personality and a reclusive lifestyle, to be specific. This plague, so to speak, was remedied through what I consider to be the most transformative period of my life: the surgery to fix my disability (allowing me to walk normally) that took place in late 2020, and the following year of rehab required for the positive effects of the surgery to come into fruition in the intended manner and time period. This rehab was transformative because it forced upon me suffering, and through this suffering I was able to become better, not just physically but mentally; my mindset was forever changed. I adopted a mindset that allowed me to see suffering as a bind that connects all humans (an idea predicated upon the belief that life itself is suffering), which allowed me to forgo any sort of indignation I felt towards the world and become a more compassionate and capable person. In any case, after the rehab concluded, I decided to take my life more seriously, a reflection of my aforesaid mindset, and thus started to really try in all domains it has to offer. Such is the explanation for my academic success in both high school and college, of which the former I graduated at sixteen with a 4.5 GPA and the latter of which I am currently a sophomore in computer science with a 4.0 GPA and on track to graduate at nineteen; my creative endeavors that are realized through the lens of authoring a soon-to-be-finished fiction novel and a blog, the website for which I am currently developing; and finally my professional capability that is a result of my independent learning of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
