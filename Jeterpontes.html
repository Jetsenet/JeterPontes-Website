<p>Hello! Welcome to my personal website!</p>

<p>I am a sixteen-year-old full-time computer science student in my sophomore year of college (save me from Python and C++!).</p>

<p>My favorite thing to do isn't coding but creative writing, however. Such is the explanation for my current creative pursuit of authoring a fiction novel, which is soon to be done.</p>

<p>I also like reading; my favorite book has to be "Man's Search for Meaning" by Victor Frankl.</p>

<p>In terms of music, I'm kind of all over the place. I usually listen to a mix of The Beatles, Kendrick Lamar, Beach House, Mac Demarco, and Artic Monkeys.</p>

<p>Regarding moral philosophy, I'm definitely part of the school of thought that doesn't believe in objective morality.</p>

<p>If there was one thing I could urge all humans to do, it would be to abandon all forms of resentment.</p>

<p>Here is my <a href="Jeterpontes2.html">bio.</p></a>

<p>I also want to start posting videos about philosophy on YouTube.</p>

<p>This image is a thumbnail I made for a potential series on sixteenth/seventeenth century philosopher Miyamoto Musashi.</p>

<p>It took me roughly thirty minutes to color the background yellow because I couldn't figure out how to isolate the character from said background and thus had to zoom into pixel-view to avoid coloring him.</p>

<p>That should give you a good idea of how bright I am...</p>
